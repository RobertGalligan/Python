from math import ceil, floor # math is a module and ceil and floor are functions in that module
from math import *  #using the * means it will import all functions from math
import math     # doing it this way will allow you to import math but you must use math.floor and math.ceil to make it work.
print(math.floor(3.7))
print(math.ceil(3.7))
